👋 Hello, my name is Cristina and I'm passionate about coding and the IT industry. I really wish to learn as much as I can about programming.
 I'm currently a student in college, looking for all the help I can get on this platform and hopefully become a part of this welcoming community.
 Even though front-end programming seems appealing, I'm more of a back-end programmer.
✨I'm really interested in knowing programms work at their core, about their functionality and how to always improve them.✨
 I would really love to know new languages and improve myself.
 💞
